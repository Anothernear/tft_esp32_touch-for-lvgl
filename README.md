# tft_esp32_touch-for-lvgl
this is the lvgl 9.2.2 configuration for a tft-esp32 touch pcb that a bought in aliexpress, in the jessenie store, and I had some problems to configure the lvg in the lastes version (at this moment is lvgl 9.2.2) and I think it will be a good idea to bring a setup configuration to inizialize lvgl in to be functional in the pcb
